<p>Garden snails are probably what you think of when you hear the word "snail." The most common type of snail, they can be found almost anywhere in the world. Their diet mostly consists of fruit and vegetables, however they will also sometimes scavenge animal matter, such as other snails. They are also decomposers, as they feed on rotting plant matter. In several places, they are considered garden pests, mostly those where they were introduced by humans. While not the primary species bred for consumption, they are still a common choice in snail dishes like escargot. </p>
