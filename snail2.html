<p>One of the biggest snail species in the world, they can grow up to 8 inches in length. Even the smaller ones usually get to about the size of your hand. They are commonly kept as pets, but it is also illegal in several countries to do so, as they are an invasive species in most places, known to eat many different fruits, plants, and causing damage to certain types of buildings. Due to their size they have very long shells, almost resembling conch shells.
